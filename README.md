Welcome to Foobar School's main repository. Here you can find the school's academic material.

#### What is Foobar School?

Foobar School is a project-based coding school.

- Mission:

#### Language Sprints

At Foobar School, the best way to start with a new programming language is by taking one of our "language sprints". These are 2-week accelerated programs that will take you from zero knoweldge of a programming languge to the point where you can start building stuff with it.

We currently offer 5 different language sprints:

- Go

- JavaScript

- Ruby

- C

- Python

Once you finish any of these sprints, head to one of our projects and start building some real good stuff.

#### Projects

At Foobar School we believe that the best way to learn is by doing projects. Like some one once said: *"I hear and I forget; I see and I remember; I do and I understand."* That's why everything at Foobar School is hands-on. You won't find any lectures here or a massive list of MOOCs that you should take. Instead, you will find a very dedicated curriculum of real world projects, a fined-grain selected list of resouces, and fully hands-on tutorials that will introduce you to new notions but not teach in full detail. Wait, what? Yes, were are not here to teach you! We are here to show you what to do so that you don't lose time figuring out, but it's upto you to learn and fulfil your goals. Here you can find a list of your projects to start working on. However, we recommend you to follow our roadmap galaxy.
